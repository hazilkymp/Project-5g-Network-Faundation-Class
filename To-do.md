# Phase 1: Developing the Virtualized Video Adapter (vAdapter)
The vAdapter is a core component that needs to parse and adapt video traffic:
1. Create a Go-based vAdapter module
2. Implement packet inspection using libpcap
3. Implement H.265/HEVC layer identification:
     - Parse RTP headers and identify HEVC NAL units
     - Classify packets as Base Layer (BL) or Enhancement Layers (EL) 

# Phase 2: Context-Aware QoE Management Framework
1. Create the Video Quality Assurance Manager (VQAM):
     - Develop monitoring components for network conditions
     - Implement metrics collection for video streams
2. Implement the SDN Video Quality Orchestrator (SDN-VQO):
     - Integrate with the Free5GC control plane
     - Develop decision logic for adaptation

# Phase 3: SDN and NFV Integration
1. Setup a lightweight SDN controller compatible with Free5GC
2. Implement SDN applications for traffic management:
     - Create custom modules for path management
     - Develop interfaces between vAdapter and SDN controller
3. Deploy vAdapter as a VNF:
     - Create a containerized version of vAdapter
     - Configure it to be deployed dynamically

# Phase 4: Testing and Benchmarking
1. Generate test traffic:
     - Create scripts to simulate various video streaming scenarios
     - Vary the number of concurrent streams and network conditions
2. Measure and compare:
     - Benchmark bandwidth usage with and without adaptation
     - Measure latency under different load conditions
     - Evaluate QoE metrics (PSNR, SSIM, etc.)
