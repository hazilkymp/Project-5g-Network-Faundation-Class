# Phase 1: Developing the Virtualized Video Adapter (vAdapter)
The vAdapter is a core component that needs to parse and adapt video traffic:
1. Create a Go-based vAdapter module
2. Implement packet inspection using libpcap
3. Implement H.265/HEVC layer identification:
     - Parse RTP headers and identify HEVC NAL units
     - Classify packets as Base Layer (BL) or Enhancement Layers (EL) 

# Phase 2: Context-Aware QoE Management Framework
1. Create the Video Quality Assurance Manager (VQAM):
     Develop monitoring components for network conditions
     Implement metrics collection for video streams
