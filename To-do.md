# Phase 1: Developing the Virtualized Video Adapter (vAdapter)
The vAdapter is a core component that needs to parse and adapt video traffic:
1. Create a Go-based vAdapter module
2. Implement packet inspection using libpcap:
3. Implement H.265/HEVC layer identification:
     Parse RTP headers and identify HEVC NAL units
     Classify packets as Base Layer (BL) or Enhancement Layers (EL)
